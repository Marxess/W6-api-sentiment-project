<img src='https://blog.indiegala.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/got.jpg'>

### Project Goals:

1. Create an API that serves information to clients (in response to their GET requests).

2. Create an API that receives data from your clients (via their POST requests) and saves it to your own database

### Project Development:
- I chose a GoT ('Game of Thrones') dataset, which includes the script of all seasons. 

- I created an API with its correspoding GET and POST endpoints, whose details can be seen by using Visual Studio Code.

- Project has been organized by grouping functions in different folders (getdata, postdata), with the main code stored in 'miapi.py'. 
- Additionally, notebooks with explanatory notes have been included to illustrate the output of the queries and to further explain the creating-and-calling-API process.
